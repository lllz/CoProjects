## About the project

[The Astropy Project](http://www.astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a core package for astronomy using
the Python programming language and improve usability, interoperability,
and collaboration between astronomy Python packages.
The core –êstropy package contains functionality aimed at professional astronomers and
astrophysicists, but may be useful to anyone developing astronomy software.
The Astropy Project also includes "affiliated packages," Python packages
that are not necessarily developed by the core development team,
but share the goals of Astropy, and often build from the core package's code and infrastructure.

## How I can participate

The Astropy project is made both by and for its users and they accept [contributions](http://www.astropy.org/contribute.html) of many kinds.

 #### Contribute code or documentation:

 If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to Astropy (whether the core package or affiliated packages), you should join the [astropy-dev mailing list/forum](http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev), and start looking at any related issues.

**[How to make a code contribution](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html)**

 #### Develop an affiliated package

 Whether you have an idea for a new Astronomy package, or already have a package that you want to integrate with the Astropy project, you can develop an affiliated package!

 #### Contribute feedback

 There are several ways:
  - join the [astropy mailing list](http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy) and post there.
  - e-mail [astropy-feedback@googlegroups.com](mailto:astropy-feedback@googlegroups.com)
  - communicate in the [#astropy freenode.net IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=astropy)
