# About the project

SatNOGS is a Satellite Networked Open Ground Station. It’s a network of satellite ground stations focused on observing and receiving the signal of satellites, particularly low earth orbit (LEO) CubeSats.

SatNOGS started in mid-April 2014, during the NASA Space App Challenge hackathon in hackerspace.gr based in Athens, Greece.

SatNOGS provides a scalable and modular platform to communicate with them.
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are our priority and for a good reason. Hundreds of interesting projects worth of tracking and listening are happening in LEO and SatNOGS provides a robust platform for doing so.

They support VHF and UHF bands for the reception with the default configuration, which is easily extendable for transmission and other bands too.

# How I can help

They like Open Source practices in both software and hardware. You can help them by contributing to the project, making it better one commit at the time.

If you are willing to connect your rotator to the SatNOGS network it is recommended to have access to an ADSL or a 3G data connection, for uploading the data back to the network.
